             <h3>About Me and My Friends</h3>
             <p>I am a 19 year old student at MSU, but I am orginally from Geneva, Illinois. All of my friends are from highschool, so they are currently scattered
            across the U.S. Back home I had all sorts of stuff I would regulary do with my friends, like get in a late night gym sesh and pick up 50 nuggets
            at Wendy's after, or hang around my basement for hours.
             </p>

             <h3>Horror Movie Wednesdays</h3>
             <p> One of the "rituals" with two of my friends and I had was watching a bunch of horror movies
            together on Wednesdays. It was always me and my friends and Owen and Jared that would get together. Sadly, we are split very apart at college, but
            we still have found a way to make it work but streaming over Discord. So, now every Wednesday at 7 EST we watch another movie or two over Discord.</p>

                We’ve seen new releases including Longlegs and The Last Straw. 
                We’ve also ventured to the depths of Netflix to find obscure films such as Old People and The Ritual.</p>
